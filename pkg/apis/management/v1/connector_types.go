// Connector represents an integration connector of the platform (shared database,
// Argo CD, observability). It is a cluster-scoped virtual resource: it has no CRD of
// its own and is served straight from the connector Secret (labeled with
// loft.sh/connector-type) in the platform namespace, through the same translating
// client every other Secret-backed management kind uses. Watch is not served in v1: a
// watch request fails instead of hanging, so list and poll instead.
//
// Rejection happens at write time only: create and update through this API validate
// the request, while a read never rejects, so pre-existing Secrets with missing
// optional fields still project. A read does re-run that validation, but only to
// report the outcome in status, so a malformed Secret is described rather than hidden.
// Writers that bypass this API and write the backing Secrets directly (the UI and
// platform controllers today) are trusted to keep the Secrets well-formed; this API
// does not defend against out-of-band malformed Secrets.
//
// Status is read-only on the wire. Whatever a request carries is ignored: a create stores
// no status and an update keeps the stored object's. Status is assembled on every read,
// part of it computed from the stored payload and part of it unpacked from an annotation
// controllers publish on the backing Secret.
//
// Metadata is the backing Secret's. Labels and annotations are served and written as they are
// stored, as on every other management kind, with the exceptions each connector type declares.
// Projected keys become fields and are not served as metadata: the loft.sh/connector-type
// label is derived from the payload section, the loft.sh/display-name annotation is spec.displayName. Server-owned keys
// are the platform's, never served, and a write that names one is refused: the status
// annotation controllers publish, unpacked into status. Withheld keys are never served: kubectl's
// last-applied-configuration annotation, because on a Secret written by hand it carries the
// whole manifest, credentials included. A write that sends a projected key disagreeing with the
// field it mirrors is refused. Labels the
// tenancy layer owns (tenant.vcluster.com/*) are that layer's, not this type's: an operator
// sees them and assigns a connector to a tenant by writing one, while a tenant never sees them
// and a tenant's write naming one is refused. Finalizers and ownerReferences round-trip.
// managedFields are served with this API's apiVersion. A label selector on
// loft.sh/connector-type still narrows a list to that type although the served object does not
// carry the label. Because the last-applied annotation is withheld, a client-side kubectl apply
// never finds it and reports a permanent diff: use server-side apply, imperative writes or
// full-replace updates.
//
// Credentials live in the type-specific payload sections of spec and are served only to
// a caller who could update this connector: one holding the update verb on it. Every
// other caller reads a redacted projection with the credential fields empty.
//
// Tenancy in this release: a platform admin creates connectors and assigns one to a
// tenant through the tenancy layer's exclusive assignment. A tenant reads the connectors
// assigned to it, redacted, and cannot create, update or delete a connector; every other
// connector is not found. Tenant-authored connectors come later, without a change to this
// type.
//
// An update through this API replaces the backing Secret from the request; nothing is read
// from the stored Secret to merge with. Passthrough labels and annotations, finalizers and
// ownerReferences round-trip because they are served and sent back. A credential the
// request leaves empty keeps its stored value, and the conditions controllers published
// are carried over from the stored object. What this API never serves does not survive an
// update: Data keys the connector type does not model, and the withheld annotations. The
// keys this API writes are the ones the platform's consumers of a connector read.
//
// The verbs behave as the generic path serves every Secret-backed kind. A delete is by
// name, with no precondition on the object's UID, and is reported as completed even when
// a finalizer on the backing Secret holds the Secret back. NotFound, AlreadyExists and
// Conflict speak of connectors; an Invalid or Forbidden raised by the store itself is
// passed through as the store phrased it.
